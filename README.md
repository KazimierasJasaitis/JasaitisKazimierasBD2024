## Abstract
In the realm of computational problem-solving, deterministic algorithms often fall short in addressing complex, computationally intensive tasks. This thesis delves into one such challenge: the creation of image collages, where multiple images must be arranged on a fixed-size canvas without overlaps or unoccupied space, a problem classified as NP-Hard. The focus is on the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Harmony Search Optimization (HSO), both evolutionary optimization algorithms, in solving the Image Collage Composition problem.

The PSO and HSO algorithms are examined in detail, particularly in their application to the problem through the development of a unit test generator and the execution of performance tests. The unit test generator segments an image into `n` pieces, upon which the PSO algorithm is employed to find optimal or near-optimal placements on a canvas. The performance of PSO is critically evaluated using various metrics, leading to valuable insights and recommendations for potential enhancements and future research directions.
